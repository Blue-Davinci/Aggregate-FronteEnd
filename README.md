## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

üí°üîî**Heads Up**
The app uses `page.server.js` to communicate with the `aggregate` backend with the exception of `formless` requests such as the `feed follows` and `favorites` system which use the `API` methods using `server.js` in the `/api` route.

### Prerequisites
Prior to running the <b>Aggregate</b> project, you need to make sure that you have the following installed in your system: 
- **Node.js:** This project is built with Svelte, which requires Node.js to run. You can download Node.js from the official website.

- **Visual Studio Code:** This is the recommended code editor for this project. You can download it from the official website.

- **Svelte:** This project is built with Svelte. You can install it globally on your system by running npm install -g svelte.

- **Golang and The Aggregate Back-end:** This can be found [here](https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/Aggregate)

### Installing

You can hit the ground running by:

1. **Cloning the Repo:** Clone this repo by doing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/Aggregate-Frontend.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Done with downloading the repo? Go ahead and navigate to the directory by doing: 
Say what the step will be

```bash
cd aggregate-frontend
```
3. **Install Node.Js:** Haven't installed `node.js`? What are you waiting for, go ahead and download it from their [official website](https://nodejs.org/)

4. **Install Svelte:** Now get your nose deep by downloading svelte like below: 
```bash
npm create svelte@latest 
```

5. **Install the project's dependancies:** Proceed and install the project's dependancies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

6. **Launch the Aggregate Backend:** Start and launch the backend server by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/aggregate?tab=readme-ov-file#installing)

7. Make sure you have the following 2 files in the root folder i.e `Aggregate-Frontend\` as they hold all the links used to interact with the `API`:
```bash
.env.development
.env.production
```

8. After a succesful setup+startup of the Aggregate backend API - above- proceed and start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```
<b>The Aggreagte Frontend</b> should now be running on your local machine. You can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port number displayed in your terminal).

- After a successful startup and login, you should have something like this:

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

## Docker
Dockerfile and Docker Compose Setup:

The application uses a multi-stage Dockerfile for building and running the application. The build stage uses a Node.js base image to install dependencies and build the application. The final stage prepares the runtime environment.
The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the build and deployment process, ensuring the application is containerized and runs as expected.

To Build the application:
1. Navigate to project directory:
```bash
cd aggregate-frontend
```
2. Check and verify the following file incase you want to change any configs:

```bash
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
```
3. Run the following command to build the docker image based on the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
<p align="center">
üîç The --build option ensures that Docker Compose rebuilds the image, which is useful for incorporating the latest changes in the source code or dependencies.
</p>

## A note:
- The application uses different API connection strings based on the environment (development or production).
- The settings can be found in the `.env.development` and `.env.production` files. The prod strings involve connections to & from the docker container.

<b>You can replace this with your own connection strings.</b>
