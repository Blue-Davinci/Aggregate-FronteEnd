# Project TODOs

This document outlines the tasks and features that are planned or need to be implemented in the project.

1. **Pagination:** The backend has pagination support with the use of query parameters, but we need to implement it here.
2. **Dockerization & Deployment:** Dockerize the whole app and also add deployment instructions
3. **Better Notification Handling:** Currently, notifications are on demand/polled. In future we should either use long polling or websockets.
4. **Same for Posts:** The same factor affects the posts as well.
5. **Add A Like System:** Adding a like system for the various posts in the dashboard.
